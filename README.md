# Usage

Type `/Insert slider` and that's it!

# Customising range

In order to customise the range of the slider, simply add a value to the end of the block where in the example below, 100 is the maximum range (default: 10).

`[:div {:is "slider-jlvafjj"}100]`

# Hiding the values of the slider rangers

By default, sliders will have their values shown. If you wish to hide it, simply head to the plugin settings, and check the box to hide it.
